## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

* It felt uncomfortable, but I can tell that it reinforces concepts and I learn more without the supports.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* In spotify developers use arrays for albums, genres, playlists, etc.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* An array method if a function that can be applies to an array. For example, `.pop()`, `.push()`.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When would we use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* The purpose of a loop is to execute a block of code until it reaches the limit and a condition becomes false.

* We would use a loop with an array in order to quickly access all elements in an array.

* We would use a loop without an array to repeat a block of code a known number of times.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* It's like starting a card game and dealing each player 5 cards one at a time in a circle.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* More knowledge on how they are applies in real life situations.
