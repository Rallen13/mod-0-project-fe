# Array Methods:
* .pop: removes the **last** element from an array and returns that element.

* .push: adds one or more elements to the **end** of an array and returns the new length of the array.

* Important to note that .pop and .push interact with the last element of an array.

* .shift: similar to .pop, but removes the **first** element of an array and returns that element.

* .unshift: similar to .push, but adds one or more elements to the **front** of an array, and returns the new length of the array.

* Important to note that .shift and .unshift interact with the first element of an array.
