## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* The first thing that resonated with me about the Growth Mindset article is that growth minded individuals are more likely to succeed because they are more apt to practice frequently, persevere in the face of difficulty, and accept critical feedback. I feel like these are things I do well and that I have a Growth Mindset in that I like to be successful and succeed.

* I didn't realize how important reflection on the process of code is for advancing my coding skills and this thought was new to me.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I believe I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset because I do not like to fail at something or not be good at something so I tend practice frequently, persevere in the face of difficulty, and accept critical feedback. I think being a Physical therapist has taught me to have a growth mindset and learn these skills through my interactions with my patients. As a physical therapist we also had to use SMART goals to set goals that were measurable and achievable for my patients and I am already familiar with this process.

* I could be better at seeking out challenges. That is one thing I have never been very good at and will require work to do so.

3. What is something you are good at or knowledgeable at now, that you once weren't? How did you get those skills/knowledge? Was it hard at some point?

* PT skills and healthcare knowledge are something that I have now mastered, but at one time, I knew very little about it.

* I got these skills by attending 3 years of school, practice, persevering when things got difficult, and accepting critical feedback from my instructors.

* It was a very rigorous program that I wasn't always sure I was going to be able to complete. I persevered through it and practiced as a therapist for 8 years.


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* It was a little uncomfortable because I didn't immediately have the answer and how to do it.
* It supported my learning because I had to look back how to do it correctly and focused more on the node command that was entered to run a file in node.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* A conditional statement evaluates to true or false.

* Did you brush your teeth?

* Opt in/opt out of emails or notifications.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
