## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel comfortable asking questions. I tend to wait to long to ask questions and should ask for help sooner to not get so frustrated.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Number-handles all numbers including negative numbers and decimals.
String-letters and other characters all wrapped in single or double quotes.
Boolean-data that is true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hellow World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// or /* The purpose of a code comment is to add information for other developers in our code in our written/spoken language, as well as let us de-activate parts of our code that we want to temporarily keep from running.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable allows us to assign a value to something and reuse that value in other places.

`var pet = cat;`

In the line above: `var` is the variable keyword, `cat` is the variable name, and the word `cat` is the value. A single equals sign (`=`) is the **assignment operator**: It assigns, or stores, the value to the variable name.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Astrology App-Pattern. Variables: Name, Birthdate, time of birth. Name, string; Birthdate, number; Time, number.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenate means to "join together" multiple strings or variables by using the + sign to create a complete sentence.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

LinkedIn. Background section of profile.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option).

How many other datat types are there? Are these all of them?
